Alignment:
All the objects of the engine are made to be cache friendly. Every internal object/ structure must be created in a 
way that variables are allocated in the decsending order. Which means that larger types are on top and small types
are in the bottom. Additional padding using the DMKMemoryPadding<byteCount> can be made.
All heap allocations are 32 bit aligned.
