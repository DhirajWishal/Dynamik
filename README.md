# 
Dynamik Engine is a community driven game engine currently at its basic stages. This engine is primarily
designed for 3D FPS games.

Dynamik Engine is a set of systems working together to create one unified system. These systems, along with the 
game component system are manages, controlled and manupulated by two major components. These are the Engine 
Component and the Studio Component. Engine Component is the fastest of all which is used for game runtime and the
Studio Component is the Dynamik Studio where users can edit and control assets and different components of the
engine.

Further improvements are yet to be made.

#### All the user available classes and structures contains the "DMK" prefix.
