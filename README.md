# Dynamik: Game Engine Framework
Dynamik is a futuristic game engine framework which can be used to build a custom engine for your game.

## Why Dynamik?
Most of the time, when developers build a new engine tailor fitted to their game, they'll have to deal with a lot of "glue" code to make sure that different libraries work with each other. Dynamik provides a variety of libraries which are intercompatible and allows the developers to skip the gluing part and get right into building the engine.

## Is Dynamik specifically for engines?
No, not at all. You can use Dynamik as a game framework too and use the high level APIs as engine modules. This will save you more time if your intention is to build a game, not an engine.

## How is it licensed?
Dynamik is licensed under [Apache v2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). It is open source with minimum restrictions!

## How can I get started?
Its simple as creating a new project, adding the required include paths with the required libraries and start coding! We also have a `Demo` folder where you can find some simple demonstrations.

### Configuration
We recommend using [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) with the C++ development package downloaded. You will also need [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/) if you wish to build the repository yourself.
