Dynamik Game Engine Notes

The user defines an object named the DMKGamePackage. All the game data are passed to the engine using this
object. This class has a number of virtual methods which the user can use. These methods are called at 
predefined places.
The DMKGamePackage contains basic game information (game name, version, playtimr, ...), level data (all the
levels are passed to the engine using this), key bindings and other components. This can also be interpreted
as a direct interface to some of the engine's core components.
This object, together with the engine instance description will be used to initialize and run the Dynamik
Engine.

The rendering engine does not contain any idea about game assets. All what it renders are different meshes.
Game Asset is just a way to categorize meshes and which defines a way to manipulate them.
The rendering engine has multiple pipelines on which how a level is rendered. Some of them are debug and PBR.
If the client wishes to render all the meshes as physical entities, they can choose the PBR pipeline.
